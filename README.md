# Advanced-Number-Plate-Recognition
The Advanced Number Plate Recognition project is a Python-based application developed using TensorFlow, YOLOv3, and Haar Cascade classifiers. It aims to provide an accurate and efficient system for recognizing vehicle number plates. This project was initially developed as part of the Kavach Hackathon under the team name Cryptonics.
